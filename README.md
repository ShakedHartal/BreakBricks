# Break Bricker Game
This is a classic brick-breaker game with a twist. Each brick has a different collision strategy. The player has three lives to break as many bricks as he can without losing the ball.

# Game Rules
* The player starts with three lives, a main ball, and a paddle.
* Use the main paddle to bounce the ball and break bricks.
* The ball falling under the pedal causes a loss of life.
* Gain extra lives by destroying bricks with heart strategy and catching the falling hearts with the main paddle.
* Complete the game by breaking all bricks without losing all lives.
* The game ends when there are no remaining lives or all breaks are gone.
* The default layout is 8 bricks in a row and 7 bricks in a column.

# Usage
Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle. Bricks will break when the ball touches them. Do that by bouncing the ball off the paddle.
Collect power-ups to gain advantages or extra lives.
